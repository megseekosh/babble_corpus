* intro: 
** 1.1 has some confusing flow, sentence fragments, etc. some points of confusion
a) rather than immediately diving into ‘north american context’ and ‘english’ i think i’d probably say something like ‘generally, canonical babbling has been linked to xyz’ …BUT that was in north american settings/english. We’re just not sure if it holds globally, that’s one of the things we’d like to find out.


b) the intro previews CBR without calling it that (which i think is good!) but it also makes it seem like .15 and 10months is claimed to be _GOD’S TRUTH_ and it’s not clear to me that Oller ever meant it that way


c) things not in intro at all: CBO (i’m on board with a ‘layperson’s way to establish whether the child’ babbles) vs. a technical definition, but perhaps an explicit aim should be to see whether those actually diverge in what they tell us?
d) gender. do we actually think there will be gender differences based o previous lit? i had no preconceived notions about that for babble; if anything i’d guess there would be no gender diffs, since my read is that those emerge at the lexical level. 

** 1.2: first sentence mentions gaps but i’m not sure which gaps. also maybe describe lena (modal use case) before special case (audio+pics)—some flow/fragments here too.

** 1.3. : questions 1:3 do not seems to come clearly from either claims or gaps highlighted by intro (and gender especially seems to come out of nowhere)

METHODS
* where did those mat ed #s come from? either weird rendering or wrong info (512?) should pull from table of participant info on our osf and make any conversion from original coding clear
** 2.3: are we sure we had 100 utt’s from each of the 52 kids? i thought for tsi and yeli maybe it was actually way more than 100? i could be wrong
** 2.4: info about the clip making is preprocessing not annotation procedure
* should say something about LENA mandating CHN length which affected corpus A-C but not D-F or whatever
* should clarify that e.g. a clip of 1400ms turned into 400+400+400+200
** asterisk in table 2 doesn’t go anywhere
* i’d add direct links to qualtrics, osf, ihearuplay etc
* i think we need some sort of summary table of # of annotators, # of unique clips they each did on average, and probably just a footnote of the annotators who got the same clip twice, since i’mg guessing that happened super super rarely

RESULTS
* would be good to start with a clearly laid out analysis plan
%%%- DONE
%% eb: do you mean the first two sentences of Pre-processing of annotations? it's not really part of that section--i'd put it just right under Results.
%%% DONE


* generally speaking, i wouldn’t put in text stuff that’s in tables/figures, so no need to step through the % and N of canonical in each corpus (para 4), but i would put n AND % in table 1 
%%%- Let's talk this over with the group. In principle, I'm fine to remove this paragraph. 
%% eb:what did folks decide? i vote for minimizing redundancy, saving worsd.
%%% removed a large chunk of this now

* fig2: i find it confusing that some bars are more than one kid. in those cases could the kids be stacked with a black outline within the 
blue and pink showing each one or something? 
%%%- I tried that but some of the n are really low for some age groups (e.g. 0;3) making it hard to read when I divide the column. Since this isn't the most informative plot, though it is still interesting to see the relationship between canonical and noncanonical just by age, independent of corpus, maybe I should move it to the appendix?
%% eb: not sure where this figure went but the appendix isn't in the crossling_paper.tex and not rendering in its separate tex so maybe it's there? 
%%% I moved it to the appendix


** .2: didn’t we discuss lots of ways that apparently ppl calc CBR? we should mention/justify this somewhere
%%%- will be mentioned in the previous lit. 



* i do NOT think we should collapse over kids within an age bin ever; not sure why we’d want to?
%%%- So I moved the one table and figure where I collapsed into age bins into the appendices now. I actually do think this analysis is interesting, to look at CBR growth just by age. But I agree that it's confusing to sometimes present indivdual data points for kids and sometimes, as in the first histogram, to not do so. 
%% eb: appendix seems fine for this, just careful with description and stats given different variances/#s




* sorry but i really don’t understand the age in months vs. days distinction made throughout: i think to most readers 360 days = 11.8 months, but i think the idea here is that 360 days would actually be the 11 month ‘bin’? not sure why we need this kind of binning?
%%%- I primarily used age_in_days to avoid having to artificially visualize data by jittering overlapping points in the main CBR*age*corpus plot. But I included both age_in_days and age_in_months because age_in_months is obviously more intuitive. The only time that age_in_days comes up is for this plot and the lm/correlation I report for it. I also report the linear model results using the age_in_months variable. If using days and months still seems confusing/unncessary, let me know. I can remove it but the plot will be much harder to read (esp if I add confidence intervals, which I haven't yet). 
%% eb: i'm still confused. you can keep the age_in_days variable and still have the graph be accurate without jitter by just doing age_in_days/30.4167, and then you're not actually losing info by calling a 14.4 and a 14.0 month old the same age, and you can title the access whatever you want...the double axes are redundant without adding more info [but not a huge deal so i guess i'd fix other stuff first]
%%% removed age_in_days from visual - only reports in months now for the visual

%% eb: why wouldn't the model use age_in_days? or maybe even a centered version of that var? 
%%% There are two models, one for age in days and one for age in months to get the beta coefficient. All variables are centered (which I now explicitly mention earlier in the Results).

%% eb: Relatedly--should be specific about what the model formula. a model with one predictor if you have 1 datapoint per kid is the same as the correlation, no? but maybe you have repeated measures or random effects or smoething? or just wanted to get the beta?
%%% I wanted the beta, thus the regression, and I forgot to take out the correlation. It's just regressions now. 





* para 4: i’m not sure i’d include this info: seem like somewhat arbitrary agespans. maybe just <10mo and >10 mo? 
%%%- I didn't do all children over 10mo because that spans all the way up to 36mo. But I changed the age ranges and I think the choice of ranges should be more justified now. Lmk what you think. 
%% eb: do you mean bc now it's 2-6mo and then 7-12 mo? But then a couple sentences later it still talks about <10mo (As anticipated...) and i don't see any justification for the age-ranges (i.e. why you picked them)
%%% Because we now mention more explicitly in the prev lit and research questions that kids should reach .15 by 7 months. I changed the 10 months thing to 0;7; that was a mistake. 


* generally, it looks like the CBO and CBR results are essentially identical, no? do we actually need both sets of results in the paper vs. suppmatt? if we want both then a much clearer “just as we saw in CBR…” would be very helpful
%%%-Yes, CBO has mostly been removed now. 
%eb: why mostly? if it's staying in anywhere should be mentioned in analysis plan; if it's not staying in for some sub-analyses need tob e clear why not. definitely features prominintly in the conclusion...
%%% it's completely removed now (and also from the conclusion which I wrote when we were still going to include CBO). 



* fig 5: why only 4 corpora? it looks like this is bc of only a tiny amount of relevant data for warlaumont, but not sure why cychosz was removed? in any even this should be clearly stated somewhere, sorry if i missed it
%%%-Only four corpora because we're looking at a cross-sectional sample within each corpus. This is now mentioned more explicitly in the text. 
%% eb: i'd state this in the caption too
%%% DONE

* fig 5: i’d do smaller/hollow dots, and a free x axis
%%%-Made dots smaller and fainter to see overlap better. Isn't a free scale kind of misleading? Since some corpora (Seedlings) have smaller age range than others (Tseltal, Yeli)? Or would you suggest that I free the scale but explicitly mention in the caption that the x-axis range differs by corpus?
%% eb: yeah i'd free scale, and make dots hollow, and mention free scale in caption
%%% DONE



** .3: header says ‘by corpus’ sentence one says ‘by language’ which do you mean? i wouldn’t put the correlation data in text, i’d just make it one table with the CBO and CBR (if we keep both in main text) Rs, Ns, CIs, age-ranges, and Pvals so that text can talk about take-home not details
%%%-changed to say corpus throughout instead of language
%% eb: but what about making this (and any other # heavy parts) a table to make the para more readable?



** .4 
* not sure we need the results by gender at all—and not sure what we should be concluding. the correlations of m vs. female have overlapping CIs, and i’m not sure the potential age concern is an age concern given the wide SDs on each genders ages
%%%-We did decide in the meeting to keep the analyses by gender. I now just mention that age range *could* be a concern between males and females to help explain why we didn't replicate the finding that CBR shows stronger growth in female children than male. 
%% eb: i'd definitely downplay the age-range thing even further. "We do note that while not statistically differentiable, the females in our sample 1.5 months younger (age{sd}girls age{sd} boys); future work controlling this more precisely would be a welcome addition" or smoethiing
%%% DONE




*general point: i’m a big fan of a tiny bit of interp at the end of each results para/section to help readers sift through and tie results to the initially framed questions from intro
%%%-Have now added a quick blurb at the end of each major section that ties it back into the research questions. 
%% eb: great. but not it feels like the big explanation about the methods varying across corpora ('segmentation methodologies differed...') feels like discussion not results). so i'd advocate for a tiny interpretive statement and then pasting the bigger point you're making into discussion.
%%% DONE
